Hello!

I'm Michael, a University of Alberta graduate with a Psychology & History degree and extensive experience in Alberta's non-profit sector, particularly in volunteer coordination.
Currently, I'm pursuing a second bachelor's as a Mathematics major and an Economics minor for the purposes of combining my interests in human behavior with quantitative analysis. I aim to apply these skills to be able to pin down the "why" of trends through a variety of lenses.
This website portfolio is meant to showcase practical applications of these skills through personal projects.

My interests are particularly in:
- Program evaluation and decision making in Alberta's Not for Profit Sector.
- Applied mathematical modeling for risk assessment and decision-making.
- Practical Database Architecture and Data Governance.
- Research synthesis combining statistical and qualitative methods.
