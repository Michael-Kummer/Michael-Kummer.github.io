Through this program\u2014which [usually] runs in 12-week cycles\u2014our young participants develop a wide repertoire of cooking and kitchen-safety skills and learn about food-related topics, including nutrition, meal-planning, food-safety, and cultural diversity. The main dish and dessert recipes are chosen every week by the participants, with assistance from staff. Sessions end with a group conversation reflecting the individual children's interests, curiosities, and cultural backgrounds. The term wraps up with an exciting food related field trip. Recent examples have included Science World, and the Vancouver Christmas Market. In addition to the practical skills and knowledge that children acquire through our Kids' Kitchen Program, participants also develop a powerful sense of competence and agency regarding their food and nutrition. Like all DTES NH programs, Kids' Kitchen sessions are positive, community-building events, set in a safe and nurturing space.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEER DUTIES\r\nVolunteers duties include: guiding kids through the cooking workshop and supervising their safety and well-being; prep for and participate in art projects; after-meal clean up.\r\n\r\nASSETS\r\nWe ideally seek volunteers who have the ability to apply creative problem solving, have experience working with children and youth, and have experience with food handling and preparation.Some other valuable assets include:\r\n- lived/living experience in the DTES\r\n- work/volunteer experience in the DTES\r\n- ability to speak multiple languages\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\nWe require a minimum 11-week commitment for this position (as this cycle of the program ends at the end of June).

The secular, grassroots Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House (DTES NH) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 DTES residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low\u2010incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.  Those who built the DTES NH put the Right to Food at the heart of our work, as nutritional vulnerability was a theme familiar to all. Our goal around the Right to Food is to reform the nutritional impact, quality, abundance and delivery of food in the DTES in consultation with residents, community food providers, non\u2010food community organizations, healthcare professionals, policy makers, growers/suppliers, food/beverage industry professionals and researchers.
