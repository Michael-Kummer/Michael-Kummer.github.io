    "content": "AbstractSeniors within Canada are subject to a wide variety of scams and frauds.Seniors are also more or less vulnerable to certain scams. In the faceof increasing automation, it is critical to explore currentvulnerabilities to prepare for changing levels of scams. Seniors tend tolose more for most scams, especially scams done in person or usingmethods with an individual visible on the other end. Romance scams andinvestment scams will cause seniors to lose more. Females, especiallyfemale seniors, are vulnerable to romance scams. At the same time, malesare more susceptible to investment scams, with similar scams followingsimilar gendered patterns. Guardrails should be put in place byactuaries, financial planners, and general insurance staff.1 IntroductionDemographic, methodological, and categorical factors are critical tounderstanding scam rates within Canada, especially as the current scamand fraud landscape continues to undergo massive change. Scammerstypically target specific demographics such as seniors as they are closeto retirement and either have their retirement money in a plan they canwithdraw out of or withdraw early from their pension plans. As machinelearning and large language models become more accessible, some scamsare at risk of increasing automation. Engaging with the current scam andfraud landscape is critical to ensure that guardrails are pre-emptivelyput into place.As analyzing current trends can potentially help prevent future scams,the Canadian “Anti-Fraud Centre Fraud Reporting System Dataset” will beused to determine what exactly seniors within Canada are vulnerable to.Based on the correlations between an individual’s gender and seniorstatus, certain scams and methods targeting those demographics werefound. All significant scams and methods cause individuals to lose moreif the scams are more personable but vary in effect depending on genderand senior status. The effect on each demographic varies, as some scamswill impact seniors drastically differently from non-seniors, and thesame applies to genders.2 BackgroundSeniors within Canada have experienced a vast change before and afterCOVID-19 as seniors have become more online and increasingly isolated.Seniors have become more online at an increasing rate that spiked due toCOVID-19, with a 10% jump in internet usage between 2020 and 2022 forthose over 75.1 Post-COVID, many non-profits and volunteer-runreligious organizations have started to vanish at an alarming rate.2Local communities rely on volunteers, and without these organizations,seniors who need help can no longer receive it, and those seniors whowish to contribute have nowhere to help. This combination has led to anunfortunate situation where seniors have less community support and aremore online.Every scam can have varying impacts on the victim, and even though ascam might have a significant blow on the individual’s life, the scammight not have led to any direct monetary loss. Certain scams must bedone in conjunction with other scams, as some require precedinginformation to defraud a victim. Assigning dollars lost to scams can bedifficult as the exact dollar value of personal information is difficultto quantify, and multiple scams can be related. For example, Canada’s“Anti-Fraud Centre Fraud Reporting System Dataset” contains informationon over 300,000 scams, whether successful or unsuccessful, withinCanada. Notably, the dataset has many reports of a dollar loss of $0 asthe losses that might be taken by another institution, such as aworkplace, or the crime might have been a predecessor to a differentcrime.33 MethodologyThe analysis was done on panel data from Canada’s Anti-Fraud CentreFraud Reporting System Dataset. As of March 2025, the dataset containsobservations from 2020 to 2024, totalling around 300k observations.We’re excluding the attempt data, data where information is anonymizedor N/A, and data where losses were 0. The rationale behind this is thatnon-zero losses do not necessarily mean they are not zero and might beextremely hard to quantify. For overly anonymized data, there areinherent difficulties with analyzing NAs.Analysis Data = Victim ∩ Non-Zero Loss ∩ Not NASmall categories with few observations were combined or removed. Therewere relatively few observations for 90+-year-olds, so this category wascombined into one for 164 observations. For the methodology used, mail,television, video call, print, and radio were all combined as theyranged from 80 to 3 observations in respective order. For scamcategories, those below 200 observations were combined as the number ofobservations becomes a limitation to understanding if they might berepresentative of the population or even important to look at.Figure 1: Comparison between the Top 6 scams in frequency and theirrespective dollar loss for seniors vs non-seniors.Figure 2: Comparison between the Top 5 methods in frequency and theirrespective dollar loss for seniors vs non-seniors.3.1 ModelsCategory Interaction:\\[\\ln\\left( DollarLoss_{i} \\right) = \\beta_{0} + \\sum_{j}^{}{\\beta_{j}Category_{ij}} + \\beta_{gender}Gender_{i} + \\beta_{senior}Senior_{i} + \\beta_{year}Year_{i} + \\sum_{k}^{}{\\beta_{k}SolicitMethod_{ik}} + \\sum_{j}^{}{\\beta_{j,s}\\left( Category_{ij} \\times Senior_{i} \\right)} + \\sum_{j}^{}{\\beta_{j,g}\\left( Category_{ij} \\times Gender_{i} \\right)} + \\varepsilon_{i}\\]OLS will be used to determine the impact of each variable, and multiplemodels will be used to ensure that solicitation methods used, gender,location, and year would not influence the significance of the results.My reference categories were female, non-senior, and 2020, as that isthe first year of observations. Non-seniors were a reference categorydue to the abundance of observations, and non-seniors were more evenlyspread across the scams. Overall, the gender demographics were splitequally except for a few scams, meaning it does not have anysignificance what gender the reference category is.The reference categories and methods were chosen due to number andcomparability. The reference category chosen was Emergency Fraud, wherethe scammer pretends to be someone the victim knows and demands money toget out of jail, hospitals, or some other urgent reason to help.Emergency fraud has varied solicitation methods and typically requiressome amount of information about the victim, but it doesn’t require thescammer to spend a long period of time with the victim. DirectCall/Phone was chosen as the reference category for the solicitationmethods used due to a variety of scams being able to be done over thephone. Alongside the observation counts, phone and direct call scams canbe either completely automated or done after already having a connectionwith the victim.Data description-wise, much of the data contained categories with aneven spread. Gender was quite evenly split between males and females.There seemed to be near-normal distribution for the ages. Scams andsolicitation methods contained categories with many observations thatwere then tapered off into less commonly used categories.4 Data            Demographic &amp; Covariant      Basic      Male/Senior interaction      Solicit interaction      Category Interaction                  Intercept      7.818^***^      7.813^***^      7.798^***^      7.261^***^              Senior      0.292^***^      0.303^***^      0.410^***^      0.987^***^              Male      0.092^***^      0.099^***^      -0.058      -0.026              Male X Senior             -0.022                            Year      0.199^***^      0.199^***^      0.199^***^      0.199^***^              Observations      39888      39888      39888      39888              Adjusted R^2^      0.43      0.43      0.431      0.438              Residual Std.

Previous research aligns with this, but specificresearch has shown that educated women who score high in risk-taking arethe target scam demographic for losses.4 Not only were femalesscammed for more money, but they were also scammed more times. Forinvestment scams, males lost substantially more than females, and aspreviously, the trend continues for senior males.

Other was significant, butOther X Male and Other X Senior were not.Redo with HistogramMethodology-wise, those methods where an individual can be potentiallyvisible or acknowledge there is a person on the other end cause thevictim to lose more. Some methods also seem to be gendered, as males whomeet someone in person will lose more money than potentially a femaleover social media. This suggests that these individuals are moresusceptible to scams over these mediums or that they are more accessibleover those mediums.5 Empirical analysis and explanationScams being gendered in their impacts means that the types of languageused within the scams should be investigated. Seeing what exactly isenticing for each gender or senior category can potentially allow us tomitigate the largest contributing factors to being scammed. Sincesolicitation methods that are more personable seem to be more effectivethan those where the person on the other end is unknown, the risk fromautomated scams seems to be relatively low. Methods that are done onlineor that can be automated seem to be less effective than those thatcannot. This can be potentially due to spam filters or individuals beingwary of any potential bot activity, but it is only a matter of timebefore scammers use machine learning to augment the personable scams.The correlations between dollar loss and gendered scams or scams thatfocus on seniors seems to vary. Some scams seem to be quite successfulwith certain demographics leading to the belief that there’s somethingintrinsic about these scams and these demographics. Certain methods,such as text message scams that are most likely blind to the victim,seem indiscriminate in who they target. For those we did not see asignificant difference between men and women, which most likelyindicates that seniors will be more likely to respond to them.Alternatively, the explanation could be that seniors are more likely tohave their numbers already out there in these spam text lists.A major limitation is that we are unable to see any further detail abouteach occurrence. A substantial number of observations were removed afterthe cleaning process. Since so many attempts exist, follow-up researchshould be conducted on attempts and observations with a dollar loss of$0. What exactly scammers are taking in a $0 scenario would beextremely helpful, but as the best data we have is demographics, itwould be useful to investigate who is having information stolen fromthem.6 Conclusion and RecommendationsThe landscape for scams is always changing, and scammers will improve inboth their skills and techniques over time. It seems that scams wherethe human on the other end is more difficult to see scam individuals forless money. The dangers of automated scams will most likely have to bemet with more automation. Those scams that require coordinated teamscannot be fully automated, meaning the tactics used cannot be met withmore automation and will most likely have to be met with creativemeasures and partial automation.More research must be conducted on what exactly makes some scamsgendered and more damaging to seniors. The study on romance scams showsthat risk-taking behaviour is inherently intertwined with scamsusceptibility. However, more research will be required on unsuccessfulattempts, as some individuals might be targeted by more scams thanothers, causing the likelihood of success to be greater.Operationalizable definitions that are surveyable might allow for awider net to see what subsection of the population needs extraattention.ReferencesCanadian Securities Administrators. “Common Frauds and Scams.”Canadian Securities Administrators (website).

    "content": "Executive SummaryThis analysis, based on the Government of Alberta’s 2023 Online survey, delves into age-based differences in volunteer engagement, motivations, and barriers between seniors and non-seniors. The findings were used to create strategies for nonprofit organizations to recruit and retain volunteers, with special attention to senior volunteers who contribute disproportionately to the volunteer workforce.Current Landscapes &amp; ChallengesThe nonprofit sector of Alberta is experiencing a shift post-COVID, making the role of volunteers increasingly essential. Currently, we are seeing declines in the number of Canadians making charitable donations; some Canadians are feeling more disconnected and not donating money or time, all while service usage is at a record high (Canada Helps Giving Survey, 2024). Given these new changes, there needs to be adaptation and new techniques nonprofits use to engage communities.Previously, recruiting volunteers entailed a rough strategy consisting of cold recruitment, training and integration of volunteers; then, those volunteers would assist in recruitment through word-of-mouth. Currently, individuals are volunteering less post-COVID, meaning organizations are losing out on a crucial recruitment method (Giving Survey, 2024).My experience coordinating volunteers has consistently shown that:  A minority of highly engaged volunteers typically perform a substantial amount of volunteer work, but as the Giving Survey warns, these volunteers can burn out.  Maintaining consistent community engagement is challenging for coordinators, leading to campaign-based rather than continuous recruitment efforts.  Targeted outreach to specific demographics yields better results than broad recruitment campaigns.  College-age individuals need little reason or request to begin or try to apply for volunteering.  Seniors require genuine outreach to start volunteering at your organization.MethodsCurrently, we are working on outdated information based on the Statistics Canada Survey on Giving, Volunteering and Participating (SVGP), which is pre-COVID (2018). Our most recent raw data is based on the Government of Alberta’s 2023 Online survey. This survey contains a lot of irrelevant questions, but contains sections on volunteerism, and we have around 600 responses for volunteer-related items, so it is currently our best source of raw data on Volunteerism in Alberta.Data preparation involved:  Removing unrelated questions and standardizing related questions.  Ensuring all “Refused to Respond”’s were changed to NA.  Python (Pandas and PlotNine) are used for analysis and visualization.Our hypothesis for this analysis is whether there is a substantial difference between the challenges faced by senior and non-senior volunteers.Demographics of Survey RespondentsAge Distribution Table            Age Range      Count      Percentage                  18 to 24      67      4.3%              25 to 34      336      21.5%              35 to 44      268      17.1%              45 to 54      247      15.8%              55 to 64      325      20.8%              65 or older      321      20.5%              Total      1564      100%      Note: The limited representation of 18-24-year-olds (4.3%) restricts our ability to draw strong conclusions about this demographic.Education Level Table            Education Level      Count      Percentage                  University graduate      689      44.1%              College/trades graduate      367      23.5%              Some college/trades      220      14.1%              High school graduate      134      8.6%              Some university      95      6.1%              Less than high school      33      2.1%              Not reported      26      1.7%      Employment Status Table            Employment Status      Count      Percentage                  Working full-time      750      48.0%              Retired      333      21.3%              Self-employed      159      10.2%              Working part-time      135      8.6%              Unemployed      88      5.6%              Student      37      2.4%              Other/Not reported      62      4.0%      Limitations  Given that we have the fewest responses from the 18—to 24-year-old group, we will have a strong sampling bias against all of their responses, so we will be unable to draw any conclusions.          This is solved by creating two bins: Seniors and Non-Seniors.        We only have bins to work with here, so we cannot necessarily create a regression for all of the values. Our best case scenario would be if we had the exact ages and hours volunteered, then we could see precisely how each response affects the rate of volunteering.Key FindingsFigure 1: Who is Volunteering?Note: the 18-24 range cannot be used to predict or determine anything about their volunteering ratesAs expected, senior individuals volunteer the most hours per month. The older an individual becomes, the longer they will spend volunteering. Younger groups, such as 25 to 34-year-olds, volunteer the fewest hours per month, which is to be expected as individuals under 55 will have less time than those who are retired.Figure 2: Do Potential Volunteers Value Skill Development?In the past, I have found younger individuals to want to volunteer at places they would eventually like to work. These younger individuals also want more opportunities to grow their respective skill sets. Individuals under 55 align with this experience, as most would see increased appeal through skill-focused volunteering. Figure 3: Volunteer Appreciation Appeal by Age Group (%)In terms of volunteer appreciation, increasing levels of appreciation might not have the impact most coordinators believe it will on a subsection of volunteers. Since the distribution seems relatively even across most of the responses, volunteer appreciation is still important, but it does not positively affect all volunteers, especially older individuals.Statistical Analysis: Seniors vs. Non-SeniorsTwo groups were chosen from this survey: seniors and non-seniors. Since individuals typically retire partway through the 55 - 64 age group, it is beneficial to include that entire age group in the senior/retired persons category.Tips:  P-value: Describes the probability that we would see these results under the null hypothesis. So here, it describes whether we’d see the Senior vs. Non-Senior type of responses in the total group of volunteers.  Chi-squared: Measures variation between two unrelated groups and the result. Here, we use it to determine whether there are large variations between the two groups. We do not have random sampling, so we shouldn’t rely on it too much.

All of the results in the table are statistically significant. This significance relates to whether there is a difference between senior and non-senior answers to each challenge.In almost all categories, senior individuals have fewer challenges than non-seniors; age is the only one where this is flipped. Volunteer organizations only have control over some of these factors, such as how they advertise. However, others, such as lack of available time, might be impractical or impossible to assist with.What is Appealing to Volunteers            Appeal Factor      Seniors (%)      Non-Seniors (%)      Difference      Chi-Square      p-value      Significance                  Access to flexible scheduling opportunities      72.3%      84.9%      -12.6%      24.86      &lt;0.001      ***              Access to skill-matching opportunities      63.8%      79.2%      -15.4%      30.21      &lt;0.001      ***              Organizations supporting different ways of volunteering      69.4%      77.3%      -7.9%      8.63      0.003      **              Organizations supporting group/family volunteering      59.7%      72.1%      -12.4%      17.32      &lt;0.001      ***              Organizations that regularly recognize volunteers      68.7%      74.1%      -5.4%      3.86      0.049      *              Organizations that are welcoming and inclusive      81.2%      83.6%      -2.4%      1.05      0.306      NS              Organizations that understand community needs      79.4%      82.1%      -2.7%      1.21      0.271      NS              Access to technology training opportunities      58.9%      65.7%      -6.8%      5.13      0.024      *      Note: Significance relates to whether there is a difference between senior and non-senior answers to each challenge. Anything above neutral was combined, and anything below neutral was combined.The differences between the desire for skilled positions with flexible scheduling and the necessity for group or family-oriented volunteering are noteworthy. Non-senior volunteers tend to prefer group volunteering more than their senior counterparts. However, organizations should recognize that certain similarities across age groups are negligible, as volunteers universally value organizations that are welcoming and attuned to community needs, which are non-negotiables rather than age-specific considerations.Strategic Implications for Nonprofit OrganizationsFor Senior Volunteer Recruitment  Direct Outreach Strategies          16% of seniors cited “no one asked” as a barrier to volunteering. It can be difficult to reach out to seniors directly, so it will be easier to target community relations with senior-specific community groups such as retired professional associations, and religious organizations. Recruitment can also be assisted by leveraging word-of-mouth through existing senior volunteers.      Ex. To establish relations with a local senior community, do something specifically for them such as gifting a free event or assist at a one-off event for them. Also ensure you email current volunteers to let them know when you are recruiting.        Be Approachable          Specifically mention that seniors are welcome to volunteer when advertising. Then, use that promotional material to advertise at venues that seniors attend in your local community by using a senior program directory as a contact list.      Ex. Include imagery of senior volunteers volunteering in promotional material then place posters in an area such as a community centre that specifically has senior recreation programs and/or senior pricing rates.        Refocused Recognition          Traditional volunteer appreciation may have less impact on senior volunteers, and that effort can be replaced by emphasizing the community impact and social connection aspects of volunteering. Creating meaningful recognition that aligns with your senior volunteers’ motivations can be more important than a one-time thank you.      Ex. If many senior volunteers are involved in a particular organization, doing something positive for that members of that organization may have a greater impact.      For Non-Senior Volunteer Recruitment  Skill Development Emphasis          Clearly articulate the professional skills that can be gained through volunteering at your nonprofit. Create structured volunteer paths that build marketable experiences, and you can offer low-cost certifications and job/academic references as rewards.      Ex. Create a volunteer structure with positions for experienced individuals and upwards movability for current volunteers. The two entry routes for those positions will be either being highly qualified beforehand or by reaching enough volunteer hours. Publishing this on your website can help give a goal to current volunteers and assist with recruiting skilled volunteers.        Flexible Scheduling          Implement variable commitment options that accommodate busy schedules or develop micro-volunteering one-time opportunities. Potentially utilize technology for remote or asynchronous volunteering options.      Ex. Create small volunteering opportunities for individuals to do one-time volunteering, such as helping out with a specific event or potentially publicize a problem you have then offer rewards for solutions, akin to a call for essays.        Group Volunteering Opportunities          Create family-friendly or team-based volunteer experiences for student groups. Partner with employers or student groups for group volunteering initiatives. An added benefit is that someone else will be responsible for that volunteer group.      Ex. You can reach out to student groups and professional organizations that require volunteer hours and state that you have an event they can help with. Then, you can print out signs with their logo on it to say they helped with your event as a thank-you. As an added bonus they will most likely also repost promotional material on their social media if their logo is on it.      ConclusionThe volunteer landscape in Alberta shows clear demographic patterns that are essential for volunteer coordinators to know. Senior volunteers contribute disproportionately to the volunteer workforce and face distinct challenges from non-seniors.Post-pandemic, we can expect to see a decrease in volunteerism due to isolation and an increase in the intensity of volunteering due to the intentionality behind volunteering for the community, especially for 18- —to 24-year-olds. We will fully understand this effect once the most recent Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (GVP) survey based on 2024 data is released.The key to effective volunteer engagement lies in understanding these demographic differences and designing volunteer programs that align with each age group’s motivations, constraints, and preferences. As volunteer coordinators adapt to changing societal patterns, those who recognize and respond to these age-specific factors will be best positioned to build sustainable volunteer programs.Data source: Government of Alberta’s Open Data Portal"
