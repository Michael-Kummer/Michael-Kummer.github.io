    "content": "Note: This was a submission for an SOA Call for Essays and was also a final paper for BUEC 420: Data Analysis in Business EconomicsAbstractCanadians are subject to various frauds and scams, with the dollars lost per scam influenced by an individual’s senior status and gender. In the face of increasing automation, exploring current vulnerabilities to undermine scam innovation is critical. Results indicate seniors tend to lose more for most scam types, especially when scammers use a more personable method. Romance scams and investment scams will cause seniors to lose more. Males and females are most vulnerable to investment scams and romance scams, respectively, while seniors will lose more per scam for most types of scams. Professionals, such as financial planners, senior association management, and insurance managers, should implement creative intervention strategies.1 IntroductionAn analysis of Canadian scams reveals that the category of the scam, the method of the scam, and the demographic of the victim are related to the dollars lost per scam. A complete analysis becomes even more critical as the current scam and fraud landscape undergoes rapid innovation. Scammers are more successful with specific demographics depending on the methods and type of scam committed. As machine learning and large language models become more accessible, some scams are at risk of increasing automation. Engaging with the current scam and fraud landscape is critical to ensure that guardrails are pre-emptively implemented.Analyzing the current landscape can assist with understanding if prior American research can be applied to Canada while also giving a picture of Canada’s unique vulnerabilities. The Canadian “Anti-Fraud Centre Fraud Reporting System Dataset” will be used to determine precisely what broad effects gender and senior status have on scam efficacy. Based on the correlations between dollars lost on gender and senior status, specific scams and methods targeting those demographics were found. All significant scams and methods cause individuals to lose more if the scams are more personable but vary in impact depending on gender and senior status. The effect on each demographic varies, as some scams will impact seniors drastically differently from non-seniors, with gender following a similar pattern.2 BackgroundSeniors in Canada have experienced a vast lifestyle change due to COVID-19, as they have become more online and increasingly isolated. Seniors have become more online at an increasing rate, with a 10% jump in internet usage for those over 75 between 2020 and 2022.1 During COVID, many nonprofits and volunteer-run religious organizations have also vanished.2 Many communities that rely on volunteers and non-profits can no longer be supported by volunteering seniors, and those seniors who want to volunteer cannot, so they are left unable to and without the social network they would have otherwise had. This combination has led to an unfortunate situation where seniors have less community support and are more online.Every scam can have varying impacts on the victim, and even though fraud might have a significant blow on the individual’s life, the incident might not have led to any direct monetary loss. Specific scams require a prior successful scam on the same victim, as the scammers require preceding information to defraud a victim successfully. These grey areas make assigning dollars lost to scams difficult as the exact dollar value of stolen personal information is difficult to quantify, and multiple scams can build off another. For example, Canada’s “Anti-Fraud Centre Fraud Reporting System Dataset” contains information on over 320,000 successful and unsuccessful scams within Canada. Notably, the dataset has many victims reporting a dollar loss of $0 as the losses might have been absorbed by their workplace, or the crime might have preceded another scam where there was a monetary loss.33 MethodologyThe analysis was done on categorical data from Canada’s Anti-Fraud Centre Fraud Reporting System Dataset. As of April 2025, the dataset contains observations from January 2020 to March 2025, totalling around 324k observations. Data where information is anonymized or N/A, data where losses were 0, and non-victim data will be excluded. The rationale is that non-zero losses do not necessarily mean they are not zero and may be extremely hard to quantify. For overly anonymized data, there are inherent difficulties with analyzing NAs.Analysis Data = Victim ∩ Non-Zero Loss ∩ Not Anonymized/MissingSmall categories with few observations were combined or removed. For the methodology used, mail, television, video call, print, and radio were combined into an “other” category as these methods ranged from 80 to 3 observations in respective order. For scam categories, those below 200 observations were combined as the number of observations becomes a limitation to understanding their representation of the greater Canadian population.Figure 1: Comparison between the Top 6 scams in frequency and their respective dollar loss for seniors vs non-seniors.Figure 2: Comparison between the Top 5 methods in frequency and their respective dollar loss for seniors vs non-seniors.3.1 ModelsCategory Interaction:\\[\\ln(DollarLoss_i) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_j \\beta_j Category_{ij} + \\beta_{gender}Gender_i + \\beta_{senior}Senior_i + \\beta_{year}Year_i + \\sum_k \\beta_k SolicitMethod_{ik} + \\sum_j \\beta_{j,s}(Category_{ij} \\times Senior_i) + \\sum_j \\beta_{j,g}(Category_{ij} \\times Gender_i) + \\varepsilon_i\\]An OLS regression will determine each variable’s impact, and multiple models will be used to ensure that interactions between solicitation methods, gender, location, and year will be visualizable. The natural log of the dollar loss amount was used due to the extremely wide range between the minimum and maximum scams. Non-seniors were a reference category due to the abundance of observations, and non-seniors were more evenly spread across the scams. Overall, the gender demographics were split equally except for a few scams, meaning it does not have any significance what gender the reference category is. The year was chosen as it is simply the first year of observations.The reference categories and methods were chosen due to their size and comparability. The reference category chosen was Emergency Fraud, where the scammer pretends to be someone the victim knows and urgently requests money for bail, a hospital bill, etc. Emergency fraud has varied solicitation methods and typically requires some information about the victim but does not require the scammer to build a relationship with the victim. Direct Call/Phone was chosen as the reference category for the solicitation methods due to the ability to do various scams over the phone. Alongside the observation counts, phone and direct call scams can be automated or done manually.Data description-wise, much of the data contained categories with an even spread. Gender was relatively evenly split between males and females. There was near-normal distribution for the ages. Scams and solicitation methods contained few categories with many observations and some categories with very few observations.3.2 Robustness CheckDue to the abundance of interaction terms, multicollinearity and homoskedasticity become problematic as the interaction terms start to predict each other. As a robustness check, values under 100, 500, and 1000 and those above 25,000, 50,000, and 100,000 were dropped. Removing either bound drastically decreases the $R^2$ to the 0.15 to 0.25 range, while removing both only minorly decreases the $R^2$ to around 0.3, meaning the extremes add explanatory power to the model. Multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity also become problematic with this many interaction terms. The basic and male/senior interaction models do not suffer from the term amount issues, but these models are only capable of an extremely simplified view. Methods to penalize specific interactions could be implemented on top of a simple demographic model, creating a more technically robust but more complex model.4 DataFigure 3: Demographics            Variable      Basic      Male/Senior interaction      Solicit interaction      Category Interaction                  Intercept      7.821***      7.814***      7.823***      7.266***              Male      0.084***      0.092***      -0.059      -0.044              Senior      0.301***      0.314***      0.396***      0.999***              Year      0.164***      0.164***      0.164***      0.164***              Adjusted R²      0.424      0.424      0.424      0.431      Note: The table’s reference category is Emergency Fraud, and the reference solicit method is direct call.p&lt;0.1; **p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01Figure 4: Scam Category Vulnerability Profile            Scam &amp; Interaction Term      Basic      Male/Senior interaction      Solicit interaction      Category Interaction                  Recovery Pitch      0.771***      0.774***      0.789***      0.998***              Recovery Pitch X Male                           0.364**              Recovery Pitch X Senior                           -0.468**              Investment      1.925***      1.928***      1.935***      2.317***              Investment X Male                           0.251**              Investment X Senior                           -0.735***              Extortion      0.033      0.035      0.058      1.090***              Extortion X Male                           -0.947***              Extortion X Senior                           -0.439***              Romance      1.958***      1.960***      1.968***      2.525***              Romance X Male                           -0.509***              Romance X Senior                           -0.303**      Note: The table’s reference category is Emergency Fraud, and the reference solicit method is direct call.p&lt;0.1; **p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01Figure 5: Comparison of frequency of gender and seniority status in investment and romance scamsFor romance scams, females will lose more than males, especially females who are non-seniors. Previous American research aligns with this, but specific research has shown that educated women who score high in risk-taking are specifically the most vulnerable to this type of scam.4 Results here show that females were both scammed for more money and were scammed more times than males. Women who are not seniors are scammed more often, but female senior women are scammed for more per scam.Investment and recovery scams tend to cause male victims to lose more, with senior males losing more per scam but less overall. There is detailed American research on investment scams, with the exact demographics being individuals who are not financially destitute and willing to engage in risky behaviour.5 The study predicts that the desire to gain wealth is driving male individuals to seek out unregulated investing areas.6Figure 6: Method Vulnerability Profile            Method &amp; Interaction Term      Basic      Male/Senior interaction      Solicit interaction      Category Interaction                  Email      -0.676***      -0.676***      -0.799***      -0.581***              Email X Male                    0.470***                     Email X Senior                    -0.227***                     Internet      -0.592***      -0.591***      -0.632***      -0.499***              Internet X Male                    0.205***                     Internet X Senior                    -0.114**                     Social Media      -0.722***      -0.722***      -0.712***      -0.607***              Social Media X Male                    0.107**                     Social Media X Senior                    -0.108*                     Text Message      -0.324***      -0.325***      -0.215***      -0.226***              Text Message X Male                    0.008                     Text Message X Senior                    -0.326***             Note: The table’s reference category is Emergency Fraud, and the reference solicitation method is direct call. Other was significant, but Other X Male and Other X Senior were not.p&lt;0.1; **p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01Figure 7: Comparison of gender and seniority status for email, internet, and social media scams.A breakdown of methodologies shows that some methods are gendered, but there are more pronounced differences between seniors and non-seniors. The seniority difference is stark in that seniors are scammed fewer times online, but they lose a substantially larger amount per scam. This suggests that these seniors are more susceptible to scams over these mediums, and non-seniors are more accessible over these mediums.5 Empirical analysis and explanationScams being gendered in their impacts means that the types of language used within the scams should be investigated. Seeing what exactly is enticing for each gender or age category can potentially allow us to mitigate the most significant contributing factors to being scammed. Since more personable solicitation methods are more effective than those where the person on the other end is unknown, the risk from automated scams appears to be relatively low. Protecting seniors online needs to become a priority as they are losing more per scam that might be easily preventable. Still, it is only a matter of time until scammers use machine learning to augment personable scams.The correlations between dollar loss and gendered scams or scams that focus on seniors vary. Some scams are quite successful with specific demographics, leading to the belief that there is something intrinsic about these scams and these demographics. Specific methods where the victim is unknown, such as text messages, seem indiscriminate in who they target and have no significant demographic differences. In comparison, email is also indiscriminate, yet something specific about males and non-seniors causes them to lose more money over email. This contrast might be explained by the perception of emails versus text messages. For example, a fake login portal bank notification or e-transfer may seem more legitimate over email than text, but more research is needed to conclude why this difference exists.A significant limitation is that we cannot see further details about each occurrence. Since so many unsuccessful attempts exist, follow-up research should be conducted on attempts and observations with a dollar loss of $0. As mentioned, the category amounts in this model are cumbersome, so a more technically robust lasso regression or other penalized method could better explain the current trends seen, especially when focusing on only larger or smaller losses. The dataset is also updated frequently, so predictive analysis is possible as multiple times a year, there are more observations to test models on.6 Conclusion and RecommendationsAs seniors become more online and have less social support, their susceptibility to being scammed for large sums of money becomes a critical concern. Retirement organizations such as teacher associations and advocacy groups should ensure seniors understand potential scam techniques. AI scam calls could be prevented entirely if seniors were taught to call the individual requesting money to ensure it is genuinely them and not a spoofed call. Suppose the individual is calling from potentially a hospital or courthouse; in most realistic situations, the transfer of funds can wait until the senior is at the location and can verify it is true, especially as they would most likely go to that location anyway.More research must be conducted on what exactly makes some scams gendered and more damaging to seniors. The study on romance scams shows that risk-taking behaviour is inherently intertwined with romance scam susceptibility. The investment scam study shows that, most likely, individuals scammed by fake investments were looking for grey areas to gain money. How to use this information to help prevent scams is quite complex and will most likely have to be tailor-made.Due to the unique nature of some scams and the rapid advancements currently being made, creative measures should be implemented for each scam category, and preventing initial contact should be focused on for all scams. The landscape for scams is constantly changing, and scammers will improve in both their skills and techniques over time. The dangers of automated scams will likely have to be met with more automation. Scams requiring prolonged contact cannot be fully automated, but as automation techniques become more impressive, protecting some victims from themselves will become increasingly challenging.AppendixAll Models:Model 1: Base Vulnerability Model:\\[\\ln(DollarLoss_i) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_j \\beta_j Category_{ij} + \\beta_{gender}Gender_{Male} + \\beta_{senior}Senior_i + \\sum_k \\beta_k SolicitMethod_{ik} + \\beta_{year}Year_i + \\varepsilon_i\\]Model 2: Male-Senior Interaction:\\[\\ln(DollarLoss_i) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_j \\beta_j Category_{ij} + \\beta_{gender}Gender_i + \\beta_{senior}Senior_i + \\beta_{g×s}(Gender_i \\times Senior_i) + \\sum_k \\beta_k SolicitMethod_{ik} + \\beta_{year}Year_i + \\varepsilon_i\\]Model 3: Solicitation Interaction:\\[\\ln(DollarLoss_i) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_j \\beta_j Category_{ij} + \\beta_{gender}Gender_i + \\beta_{senior}Senior_i + \\beta_{year}Year_i + \\sum_k \\beta_k SolicitMethod_{ik} + \\sum_k \\beta_{k,s}(SolicitMethod_{ik} \\times Senior_i) + \\sum_k \\beta_{k,g}(SolicitMethod_{ik} \\times Gender_i) + \\varepsilon_i\\]Note: Model 4 is our main model and is represented in 3.1 ModelsAnalysis Data Description:Figure A.1: Solicitation Methods            Solicitation Method      Count                  Social Media      15991              Internet      13184              Direct call      7182              Email      3275              Text message      2270              Door to door/in person      749              Other      168      Figure A.2: Scam/Fraud Category            Category      Count                  Investments      9632              Merchandise      8012              Service      4507              Vendor Fraud      3387              Job      3264              Romance      2698              Bank Investigator      2213              Counterfeit Merchandise      1885              Extortion      1662              Emergency      1654              Other      840              Spear Phishing      814              Loan      719              Prize      648              Recovery Pitch      518              Grant      366      Figure A.3: Age Breakdown            Age Group      Count                  1 - 20      1360              20 - 29      7430              30 - 39      7042              40 - 49      6357              50 - 59      5945              60 - 69      6318              70 - 79      4045              80 - 89      1250              90+      164      Figure A.4: Gender Breakdown            Gender      Count                  Male      21618              Female      21201      References            Statistics Canada, “Canadian seniors more connected than ever,” StatsCAN Plus, August 14, 2023, accessed April 10, 2025, https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/sc-plus/articles/2023-08-14-canadian-seniors-more-connected-than-ever. &#8617;&#xfe0e;              Don McRae, “Volunteer-Supporting Charities Are Closing at Alarming Rates,” PANL Perspectives, Carleton University, August 22, 2023, https://carleton.ca/panl/2023/volunteer-charities-close-at-alarming-rates/. &#8617;&#xfe0e;              Royal Canadian Mounted Police, “Description and Associated Definitions of Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) Statistics” (Ottawa: Royal Canadian Mounted Police, n.d.), 4. &#8617;&#xfe0e;              Monica T.

    "content": "Executive SummaryThis analysis, based on the Government of Alberta’s 2023 Online survey, delves into age-based differences in volunteer engagement, motivations, and barriers between seniors and non-seniors. The findings were used to create strategies for nonprofit organizations to recruit and retain volunteers, with special attention to senior volunteers who contribute disproportionately to the volunteer workforce.Current Landscapes &amp; ChallengesThe nonprofit sector of Alberta is experiencing a shift post-COVID, making the role of volunteers increasingly essential. Currently, we are seeing declines in the number of Canadians making charitable donations; some Canadians are feeling more disconnected and not donating money or time, all while service usage is at a record high (Canada Helps Giving Survey, 2024). Given these new changes, there needs to be adaptation and new techniques nonprofits use to engage communities.Previously, recruiting volunteers entailed a rough strategy consisting of cold recruitment, training and integration of volunteers; then, those volunteers would assist in recruitment through word-of-mouth. Currently, individuals are volunteering less post-COVID, meaning organizations are losing out on a crucial recruitment method (Giving Survey, 2024).My experience coordinating volunteers has consistently shown that:  A minority of highly engaged volunteers typically perform a substantial amount of volunteer work, but as the Giving Survey warns, these volunteers can burn out.  Maintaining consistent community engagement is challenging for coordinators, leading to campaign-based rather than continuous recruitment efforts.  Targeted outreach to specific demographics yields better results than broad recruitment campaigns.  College-age individuals need little reason or request to begin or try to apply for volunteering.  Seniors require genuine outreach to start volunteering at your organization.MethodsCurrently, we are working on outdated information based on the Statistics Canada Survey on Giving, Volunteering and Participating (SVGP), which is pre-COVID (2018). Our most recent raw data is based on the Government of Alberta’s 2023 Online survey. This survey contains a lot of irrelevant questions, but contains sections on volunteerism, and we have around 600 responses for volunteer-related items, so it is currently our best source of raw data on Volunteerism in Alberta.Data preparation involved:  Removing unrelated questions and standardizing related questions.  Ensuring all “Refused to Respond”’s were changed to NA.  Python (Pandas and PlotNine) are used for analysis and visualization.Our hypothesis for this analysis is whether there is a substantial difference between the challenges faced by senior and non-senior volunteers.Demographics of Survey RespondentsAge Distribution Table            Age Range      Count      Percentage                  18 to 24      67      4.3%              25 to 34      336      21.5%              35 to 44      268      17.1%              45 to 54      247      15.8%              55 to 64      325      20.8%              65 or older      321      20.5%              Total      1564      100%      Note: The limited representation of 18-24-year-olds (4.3%) restricts our ability to draw strong conclusions about this demographic.Education Level Table            Education Level      Count      Percentage                  University graduate      689      44.1%              College/trades graduate      367      23.5%              Some college/trades      220      14.1%              High school graduate      134      8.6%              Some university      95      6.1%              Less than high school      33      2.1%              Not reported      26      1.7%      Employment Status Table            Employment Status      Count      Percentage                  Working full-time      750      48.0%              Retired      333      21.3%              Self-employed      159      10.2%              Working part-time      135      8.6%              Unemployed      88      5.6%              Student      37      2.4%              Other/Not reported      62      4.0%      Limitations  Given that we have the fewest responses from the 18—to 24-year-old group, we will have a strong sampling bias against all of their responses, so we will be unable to draw any conclusions.          This is solved by creating two bins: Seniors and Non-Seniors.        We only have bins to work with here, so we cannot necessarily create a regression for all of the values. Our best case scenario would be if we had the exact ages and hours volunteered, then we could see precisely how each response affects the rate of volunteering.Key FindingsFigure 1: Who is Volunteering?Note: the 18-24 range cannot be used to predict or determine anything about their volunteering ratesAs expected, senior individuals volunteer the most hours per month. The older an individual becomes, the longer they will spend volunteering. Younger groups, such as 25 to 34-year-olds, volunteer the fewest hours per month, which is to be expected as individuals under 55 will have less time than those who are retired.Figure 2: Do Potential Volunteers Value Skill Development?In the past, I have found younger individuals to want to volunteer at places they would eventually like to work. These younger individuals also want more opportunities to grow their respective skill sets. Individuals under 55 align with this experience, as most would see increased appeal through skill-focused volunteering. Figure 3: Volunteer Appreciation Appeal by Age Group (%)In terms of volunteer appreciation, increasing levels of appreciation might not have the impact most coordinators believe it will on a subsection of volunteers. Since the distribution seems relatively even across most of the responses, volunteer appreciation is still important, but it does not positively affect all volunteers, especially older individuals.Statistical Analysis: Seniors vs. Non-SeniorsTwo groups were chosen from this survey: seniors and non-seniors. Since individuals typically retire partway through the 55 - 64 age group, it is beneficial to include that entire age group in the senior/retired persons category.Tips:  P-value: Describes the probability that we would see these results under the null hypothesis. So here, it describes whether we’d see the Senior vs. Non-Senior type of responses in the total group of volunteers.  Chi-squared: Measures variation between two unrelated groups and the result. Here, we use it to determine whether there are large variations between the two groups. We do not have random sampling, so we shouldn’t rely on it too much.

All of the results in the table are statistically significant. This significance relates to whether there is a difference between senior and non-senior answers to each challenge.In almost all categories, senior individuals have fewer challenges than non-seniors; age is the only one where this is flipped. Volunteer organizations only have control over some of these factors, such as how they advertise. However, others, such as lack of available time, might be impractical or impossible to assist with.What is Appealing to Volunteers            Appeal Factor      Seniors (%)      Non-Seniors (%)      Difference      Chi-Square      p-value      Significance                  Access to flexible scheduling opportunities      72.3%      84.9%      -12.6%      24.86      &lt;0.001      ***              Access to skill-matching opportunities      63.8%      79.2%      -15.4%      30.21      &lt;0.001      ***              Organizations supporting different ways of volunteering      69.4%      77.3%      -7.9%      8.63      0.003      **              Organizations supporting group/family volunteering      59.7%      72.1%      -12.4%      17.32      &lt;0.001      ***              Organizations that regularly recognize volunteers      68.7%      74.1%      -5.4%      3.86      0.049      *              Organizations that are welcoming and inclusive      81.2%      83.6%      -2.4%      1.05      0.306      NS              Organizations that understand community needs      79.4%      82.1%      -2.7%      1.21      0.271      NS              Access to technology training opportunities      58.9%      65.7%      -6.8%      5.13      0.024      *      Note: Significance relates to whether there is a difference between senior and non-senior answers to each challenge. Anything above neutral was combined, and anything below neutral was combined.The differences between the desire for skilled positions with flexible scheduling and the necessity for group or family-oriented volunteering are noteworthy. Non-senior volunteers tend to prefer group volunteering more than their senior counterparts. However, organizations should recognize that certain similarities across age groups are negligible, as volunteers universally value organizations that are welcoming and attuned to community needs, which are non-negotiables rather than age-specific considerations.Strategic Implications for Nonprofit OrganizationsFor Senior Volunteer Recruitment  Direct Outreach Strategies          16% of seniors cited “no one asked” as a barrier to volunteering. It can be difficult to reach out to seniors directly, so it will be easier to target community relations with senior-specific community groups such as retired professional associations, and religious organizations. Recruitment can also be assisted by leveraging word-of-mouth through existing senior volunteers.      Ex. To establish relations with a local senior community, do something specifically for them such as gifting a free event or assist at a one-off event for them. Also ensure you email current volunteers to let them know when you are recruiting.        Be Approachable          Specifically mention that seniors are welcome to volunteer when advertising. Then, use that promotional material to advertise at venues that seniors attend in your local community by using a senior program directory as a contact list.      Ex. Include imagery of senior volunteers volunteering in promotional material then place posters in an area such as a community centre that specifically has senior recreation programs and/or senior pricing rates.        Refocused Recognition          Traditional volunteer appreciation may have less impact on senior volunteers, and that effort can be replaced by emphasizing the community impact and social connection aspects of volunteering. Creating meaningful recognition that aligns with your senior volunteers’ motivations can be more important than a one-time thank you.      Ex. If many senior volunteers are involved in a particular organization, doing something positive for that members of that organization may have a greater impact.      For Non-Senior Volunteer Recruitment  Skill Development Emphasis          Clearly articulate the professional skills that can be gained through volunteering at your nonprofit. Create structured volunteer paths that build marketable experiences, and you can offer low-cost certifications and job/academic references as rewards.      Ex. Create a volunteer structure with positions for experienced individuals and upwards movability for current volunteers. The two entry routes for those positions will be either being highly qualified beforehand or by reaching enough volunteer hours. Publishing this on your website can help give a goal to current volunteers and assist with recruiting skilled volunteers.        Flexible Scheduling          Implement variable commitment options that accommodate busy schedules or develop micro-volunteering one-time opportunities. Potentially utilize technology for remote or asynchronous volunteering options.      Ex. Create small volunteering opportunities for individuals to do one-time volunteering, such as helping out with a specific event or potentially publicize a problem you have then offer rewards for solutions, akin to a call for essays.        Group Volunteering Opportunities          Create family-friendly or team-based volunteer experiences for student groups. Partner with employers or student groups for group volunteering initiatives. An added benefit is that someone else will be responsible for that volunteer group.      Ex. You can reach out to student groups and professional organizations that require volunteer hours and state that you have an event they can help with. Then, you can print out signs with their logo on it to say they helped with your event as a thank-you. As an added bonus they will most likely also repost promotional material on their social media if their logo is on it.      ConclusionThe volunteer landscape in Alberta shows clear demographic patterns that are essential for volunteer coordinators to know. Senior volunteers contribute disproportionately to the volunteer workforce and face distinct challenges from non-seniors.Post-pandemic, we can expect to see a decrease in volunteerism due to isolation and an increase in the intensity of volunteering due to the intentionality behind volunteering for the community, especially for 18- —to 24-year-olds. We will fully understand this effect once the most recent Giving, Volunteering, and Participating (GVP) survey based on 2024 data is released.The key to effective volunteer engagement lies in understanding these demographic differences and designing volunteer programs that align with each age group’s motivations, constraints, and preferences. As volunteer coordinators adapt to changing societal patterns, those who recognize and respond to these age-specific factors will be best positioned to build sustainable volunteer programs.Data source: Government of Alberta’s Open Data Portal"
