You recognize that the Wheels of Hope program requires flexibility, as we respond to the continually changing schedules of current clients and other drivers.   \r\n\r\n You enjoy meeting a variety of people and have the patience to deal with the times you may be waiting for a client to finish treatment. You can represent CCS positively as you interact with members of the public and are a guest in facilities like Hospitals, Cancer Centres and Lodges.  \r\n\r\n You are ready to do your best to make a client\u2019s ride to treatment one less thing they have to worry about, allowing them the space and focus to handle their journey in their own way.   \r\n\r\n You are comfortable using online tools, like email and our scheduling software. You have a valid driver\u2019s license with 3 or fewer demerit points and an acceptable driving record. You carry a minimum of $1M third party liability insurance on your 100% smoke-free vehicle and are willing to have criminal records check and regular driver abstract checks completed.   \r\n\r\n OUR INVESTMENT  \r\n\r\nAs an organization we will provide you with training and support to prepare you for this important role. You will be supported by the Transportation Coordinator, who will be providing your driving schedule and be there to help you throughout your time on the road.   \r\n\r\n You will be part of the larger Wheels of Hope team, including over 1600 volunteer drivers and many staff who share your desire to help as many people as possible get to their treatments.    \r\n\r\n YOUR COMMITMENT   \r\n\r\n\u2022 This is an important leadership role. We ask that you dedicate at minimum a half day to one day weekly, although we are able to accommodate those able to give a few days a month or during particular times of the year (i.e. summer months, winter months).  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Your schedule will be provided three (3) days ahead of time and will depend on busy days/periods, your preferences and client demand. If you\u2019re not getting as many rides as you\u2019re available to take, we ask you to contact your Transportation Coordinator to discuss changing your availability.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 You are agreeing to initiate and respond with regular, consistent communication between the Transportation Coordinator, clients you are scheduled to drive and other partners including other Wheels of Hope drivers.   \r\n\r\n\u2022 As a volunteer, you are a representative and ambassador who promotes the mission and value of the organization. \r\n\r\nInterested? \r\n\r\nPlease email us at volunteer@cancer.ca or to sign up now visit: www.volunteercancer.ca"],["dateEntered",1745452800000.0],["dateRemoved",1746230400000.0],["isActive",0],["opportunityURL",null],["activities","[{\"category\": \"Construction, Transportation, Maintenance\", \"name\": \"Driving\"}]"],["activityCategory",["Construction, Transportation, Maintenance"]],["totalDaysUp",9]]},{"type":"map","entries":[["oppID",38868],["title","Youth Educator Volunteers - Vancouver, Burnaby, North Shore"],["orgID",410],["remoteOrOnline",0],["dates","1.5 years"],["description","Volunteer with the BC Crisis Centre!

We are looking for one Co-Director of Events to lead the CI Group, and the other to lead the KP group. Everyone who applies through this form will be considered for both leadership positions, and the final appointment will be determined collaboratively with applicants. \r\n\r\nThe Co-Directors of Events work together to manage the Events Team's activities. The Events Team is currently split into two working groups: the Community Initiatives (CI) group and the Keystone Projects (KP) group. CI produces smaller events once every three months, and past events include educational webinars, community roundtables, photovoice projects, and social media campaigns. The KP group works to produce a single in-person event, which requires roughly one year of dedicated development. This event is an open-air initiative promoting Albertan mental health resources, community building activities, and mental health dialogue. \r\n\r\nRegardless of group, Events Team volunteers shed light on mental health struggles from a youth perspective. We address social justice topics (e.g., housing insecurity, LGBTQ+ rights, responsible leadership) using a nuanced, evidence-based approach, and produce initiatives built with, not for, the local community. As Co-Director of Events, your role is to support Events Team volunteers in their daily tasks. You will take the lead in scheduling and facilitating weekly meetings, where general volunteers brainstorm events, share progress updates, and receive feedback from yourself and each other on their work. In between meetings, Events Team volunteers may learn to conduct research, build budgets, and complete grants, depending on the initiatives they are producing, and may require mentorship from you. You are also responsible for planning any additional meetings that you feel supports the team, such as a virtual social night.\r\n\r\nAs a team director, you will work closely with FYM's executive leadership.

The secular, grassroots Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House (DTES NH) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 DTES residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low\u2010incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.

Through this program\u2014which [usually] runs in 12-week cycles\u2014our young participants develop a wide repertoire of cooking and kitchen-safety skills and learn about food-related topics, including nutrition, meal-planning, food-safety, and cultural diversity. The main dish and dessert recipes are chosen every week by the participants, with assistance from staff. Sessions end with a group conversation reflecting the individual children's interests, curiosities, and cultural backgrounds. The term wraps up with an exciting food related field trip. Recent examples have included Science World, and the Vancouver Christmas Market. In addition to the practical skills and knowledge that children acquire through our Kids' Kitchen Program, participants also develop a powerful sense of competence and agency regarding their food and nutrition. Like all DTES NH programs, Kids' Kitchen sessions are positive, community-building events, set in a safe and nurturing space.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEER DUTIES\r\nVolunteers duties include: guiding kids through the cooking workshop and supervising their safety and well-being; prep for and participate in art projects; after-meal clean up.\r\n\r\nASSETS\r\nWe ideally seek volunteers who have the ability to apply creative problem solving, have experience working with children and youth, and have experience with food handling and preparation.Some other valuable assets include:\r\n- lived/living experience in the DTES\r\n- work/volunteer experience in the DTES\r\n- ability to speak multiple languages\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\nWe require a minimum 11-week commitment for this position (as this cycle of the program ends at the end of June).

The secular, grassroots Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House (DTES NH) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 DTES residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low\u2010incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.  Those who built the DTES NH put the Right to Food at the heart of our work, as nutritional vulnerability was a theme familiar to all. Our goal around the Right to Food is to reform the nutritional impact, quality, abundance and delivery of food in the DTES in consultation with residents, community food providers, non\u2010food community organizations, healthcare professionals, policy makers, growers/suppliers, food/beverage industry professionals and researchers.

The HR Specialist will enter into a 3-way partnership with Mom2Mom Child Poverty Initiative Society and PMV.  This will include additional responsibilities and benefits for the HR Specialist. \r\n\r\nThe Organization - Mom2Mom Child Poverty Initiative Society\r\n\r\nMom2Mom Child Poverty Initiative Society was founded in 2012 by doctors in the community who aimed to improve the lives of children in poverty by supporting their moms. More than 150,000 children in BC live in poverty. Without intervention, research shows that these children are at risk of mental health issues, chronic health issues, addiction, and poor educational outcomes. \r\n\r\nHowever, research also shows interventions that reduce stress on single mothers living in poverty by increasing their social, emotional, and financial resources can effectively alter the course of development for their children. \r\n\r\nMom2Mom\u2019s unique model puts these elements into practice, relieving stress for moms and bringing the entire family into a community of loving support. Please visit our programs page to learn more about how we support families living in poverty. \r\nhttps://www.m2mcharity.ca/\r\n\r\nOrganization Mission \r\nOur mission is to connect moms and children living in poverty with the community, resources, and support they need to thrive.\r\nTo tangibly achieve the above, we improve the lives of children in poverty in Vancouver by supporting their moms. Mom2Mom provides moms facing the dual challenges of poverty and solo-parenting with access to additional resources that make a big impact on family life. From groceries and basic household items to extra-curricular activities for children and help during unforeseen emergencies, Mom2Mom gives moms access to a supportive community all year long. \r\nWe know that children who have healthy, determined, well-supported moms can grow and thrive in spite of poverty-related stress. \r\nProject Description\r\nThe HR Specialist volunteer will conduct an in-depth analysis of Mom2Mom\u2019s (M2M) total compensation package, benchmarking salary structures within the non-profit sector, and assessing alignment with the Cost of Living Wage (CLW) in British Columbia.
