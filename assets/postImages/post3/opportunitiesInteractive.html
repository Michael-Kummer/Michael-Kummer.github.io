CCS\u2019s Wheels of Hope program helps people who can\u2019t get to their cancer treatment appointments, providing trips when people need us most.   \r\n\r\n Wheels of Hope drivers not only provide a means for clients to get to their critical cancer treatments, but offer a safe, supportive ride along the way. You will become an important part of each client\u2019s support team, so your familiarity with Society programs and services and referring to them as appropriate will ensure everyone has access to the support they need.  \r\n\r\n WHAT YOU\u2019LL BE DOING   \r\n\r\nAs a Wheels of Hope driver, you will be responsible for:  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Responding to requests for client rides from the Transportation Coordinator, ideally via email, and wherever possible being flexible with your schedule as busy days/times/periods change  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Confirm travel arrangements with client(s) by phone   \r\n\r\n\u2022 Offer minimal assistance to get clients in and out of the car (no lifting permitted)  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Put client safety first by following safe driving procedures and keeping your license and insurance details updated  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Adhere to all Canadian Cancer Society policies, procedures, standards and guidelines including client confidentiality, role boundaries and our 100% smoke free policy  \r\n\r\n WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR  \r\n\r\nYou understand that cancer can change everything and that accessing critical programs and services creates a whole new level of community. You recognize that the Wheels of Hope program requires flexibility, as we respond to the continually changing schedules of current clients and other drivers.   \r\n\r\n You enjoy meeting a variety of people and have the patience to deal with the times you may be waiting for a client to finish treatment. You can represent CCS positively as you interact with members of the public and are a guest in facilities like Hospitals, Cancer Centres and Lodges.  \r\n\r\n You are ready to do your best to make a client\u2019s ride to treatment one less thing they have to worry about, allowing them the space and focus to handle their journey in their own way.   \r\n\r\n You are comfortable using online tools, like email and our scheduling software. You have a valid driver\u2019s license with 3 or fewer demerit points and an acceptable driving record. You carry a minimum of $1M third party liability insurance on your 100% smoke-free vehicle and are willing to have criminal records check and regular driver abstract checks completed.   \r\n\r\n OUR INVESTMENT  \r\n\r\nAs an organization we will provide you with training and support to prepare you for this important role. You will be supported by the Transportation Coordinator, who will be providing your driving schedule and be there to help you throughout your time on the road.   \r\n\r\n You will be part of the larger Wheels of Hope team, including over 1600 volunteer drivers and many staff who share your desire to help as many people as possible get to their treatments.    \r\n\r\n YOUR COMMITMENT   \r\n\r\n\u2022 This is an important leadership role.

The secular, grassroots Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House (DTES NH) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 DTES residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low\u2010incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.  \r\nThose who built the DTES NH put the Right to Food at the heart of our work, as nutritional vulnerability was a theme familiar to all. Our goal around the Right to Food is to reform the nutritional impact, quality, abundance and delivery of food in the DTES in consultation with residents, community food providers, non\u2010food community organizations, healthcare professionals, policy makers, growers/suppliers, food/beverage industry professionals and researchers.

Through this program\u2014which [usually] runs in 12-week cycles\u2014our young participants develop a wide repertoire of cooking and kitchen-safety skills and learn about food-related topics, including nutrition, meal-planning, food-safety, and cultural diversity. The main dish and dessert recipes are chosen every week by the participants, with assistance from staff. Sessions end with a group conversation reflecting the individual children's interests, curiosities, and cultural backgrounds. The term wraps up with an exciting food related field trip. Recent examples have included Science World, and the Vancouver Christmas Market. In addition to the practical skills and knowledge that children acquire through our Kids' Kitchen Program, participants also develop a powerful sense of competence and agency regarding their food and nutrition.

The secular, grassroots Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House (DTES NH) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 DTES residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low\u2010incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.  Those who built the DTES NH put the Right to Food at the heart of our work, as nutritional vulnerability was a theme familiar to all. Our goal around the Right to Food is to reform the nutritional impact, quality, abundance and delivery of food in the DTES in consultation with residents, community food providers, non\u2010food community organizations, healthcare professionals, policy makers, growers/suppliers, food/beverage industry professionals and researchers.

The secular, grassroots Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House (DTES NH) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 DTES residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low\u2010incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.  Those who built the DTES NH put the Right to Food at the heart of our work, as nutritional vulnerability was a theme familiar to all. Our goal around the Right to Food is to reform the nutritional impact, quality, abundance and delivery of food in the DTES in consultation with residents, community food providers, non\u2010food community organizations, healthcare professionals, policy makers, growers/suppliers, food/beverage industry professionals and researchers.
