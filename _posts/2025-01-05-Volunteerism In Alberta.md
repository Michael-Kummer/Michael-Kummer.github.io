# WIP

##### Background
<p>The nonprofit sector of Alberta's experiencing new trends and exacerbation of old ones. Currently we're seeing declines in the number of Canadians making charitable donations, that some Canadians are feeling more disconnected and not giving money or time, and increased service usage (Giving survey, 2024). Given these new changes there needs to be adaptation and new techniques used by nonprofits to engage communities.</p>
Previously recruiting volunteers entailed a rough strategy consisting of:
Cold Recruitment -> Training and integration -> Word-of-mouth recruitment

Given that cold recruitment is more difficult, the negative effects on nonprofits are multiplied.


From my own personal experience i've found the following to be generally true:
- A majority of the volunteer work is done by a minority of volunteers who are highly engaged
- Consistent community engagement is extremely difficult on coordinators. I've noticed most organizations work in phases or campaigns instead of constantly keeping up pressure.
- It's better to target certain populations instead of casting a wide of net as possible.
	- Ex. leadership groups, or certain student groups

Currently the nonprofit sector is facing a variety of changes that each organization can fit into:
1) They are receiving decreased donations in past years
2) They are receiving the same or more in donations from a smaller group of individuals

College age individuals need little reason or request to begin or try to apply volunteering. Seniors need genuine outreach to volunteer. Individuals in between might not volunteer unless they have an explicit reason to as in they truly want to volunteer there or they need professional hours.


##### Discussion
We know from the Giving Report that people volunteer when they feel connected and are able to see direct results - hence why environmental factors were focused upon as the results are typically not immediate and potentially less tangible. For other organizations not in environment, the decline in consecutiveness means more isolation for seniors. Since we cannot literally reach out to every senior in isolation, we must go through large community groups and have them distribute volunteering opportunities.

The pandemic has caused a lot of isolation and potentially even decline. If there's documented analysis we can make the following two hypothesis where one is based in the recent term, and one is focused on long term effects:
1) Post-Pandemic will show, we can expect to see a decrease in volunteerism due to isolation and we can see an increase in intensity in volunteering due to the intentionality behind volunteering for the community.
To make 1) disprovable, we will try to look through the most recent data, but we will fully understand this effect once the most recent Giving, Volunteering and Participating (GVP) survey based on 2024 data is released. At best, we can predict the falsifiability of this statement until the survey is released

1) Economically, we can potentially see a similar effect. Given Alberta is a resource economy definitionally it will experience large booms and large busts that is pegged directly to the value of resources. Potentially in these bust cycles we can see the same effects.
For 2) to be disprovable we can look at the data taken from 2009 and 2015 - 2016 during two Alberta recessions in the 21st century. Here we can find a more direct correlation.

##### Notes:
Your first hypothesis addresses an important paradox in post-pandemic volunteerism that the data hints at but hasn't fully captured yet. The AB Gov report and Philanthropist article both suggest this tension between isolation and intentionality. Here's how we might sharpen the hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1 (Isolation-Intensity Paradox): "Post-pandemic volunteerism will show two simultaneous but opposing trends: decreased overall participation due to disrupted social networks, but increased hours/commitment from those who do volunteer due to heightened awareness of community needs."

This is theoretically grounded because:

- The Giving Report shows declining social connections correlate with reduced volunteering
- The shift in gender distribution (50/50 to 36/64) suggests fundamental changes in who volunteers
- The "same ten people" phenomenon in rural communities indicates intensification among committed volunteers

Your second hypothesis about economic cycles is particularly relevant for Alberta. I'd suggest framing it this way:

Hypothesis 2 (Resource Economy Volunteer Cycle): "Volunteer patterns in resource-dependent economies follow a counter-cyclical pattern, with formal volunteering decreasing during economic downturns while informal community support increases."

This builds on:

- Historical data from previous resource busts
- The documented increase in service demands during economic downturns
- The shift between formal and informal volunteering noted in the AB Gov report


## Methods
Currently we're working on outdated information based on the Giving Survey that is pre-covid. The most recent raw data we have is based on the Government of Alberta's 2023 Online survey. This survey is extremely broad, but contains sections based on volunteerism and we have around 600 responses for volunteer-related items so it is currently the best we have.

In cleaning the data I replaced the questions with the guidebook, then I simplified the questions. Notably right after this we can see the following for how much time is being spent volunteering:

##### Challenges

##### Possible Improvements

Interestingly enough for possible improvements it seems as senior volunteers are not entirely engaged by volunteer appreciation awards. Volunteering for meaning is a reward in itself to some.





##### Correlations

Since we are working with solely categorical and binned data we are limited in our options for finding out relations between variables.
